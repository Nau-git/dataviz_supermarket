# Welcome to my repository!

This is the repository for my first dashboard project. The libraries used are pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and streamlit (to deploy to the heroku webapp). Currently, the dashboard contains several data visualizations and also two hypothesis testings. The notebook file is where I do the overall exploration, and the .py file is the script to deploy the project. I will give updates (add more features) gradually. In the meantime, feel free to reach out or post in Issues if you have any questions.

Cheers
